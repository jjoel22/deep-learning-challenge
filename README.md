In the intial optimization iteration, I excluded a column and adjusted the threshold for the application type and classification columns. In the subsequent optimization step, I introduced a third hidden layer and expanded the number of nodes in the existing hidden layer. Finally, in the third attempt, I switched all activation function to sigmoid and extended the training time by doubling the number of epochs for the model.

The baseline attempt was 72.6 where it outperformed all three attempts effort. which was 72.23 for the first attempt, and 72.27 for the second and third attempt respectively.
